# European sea bass genome and its variation provide insights into adaptation to euryhalinity and speciation, Tine et al., 2014, Nature Communications.

<p style="text-align:justify";>The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a temperate-zone euryhaline teleost of prime importance for aquaculture and fisheries. This species is subdivided into two naturally hybridizing lineages, one inhabiting the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the other the Mediterranean and Black seas.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>expansions of gene families specifically associated with ion and water regulation, high- lighting adaptation to variation in salinity.We further generate a genome-wide variation map through RAD-sequencing of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>This is an economically important species, and natural stocks are subject to intensive exploitation by professional and sport fisheries, thus raising future conservation and management issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>The European sea bass inhabits coastal waters, where reproduction occurs; however, it can also enter brackish waters in estuarine areas and coastal lagoons, and occasionally rivers. Thus, the European sea bass is an euryhaline fish tolerating a wide range of salinities (0-60 psu)1. Although several genes involved in the physiological response to variation in salinity have been identified2, the genetic basis of its broad halotolerance remains unclear. Because adaptation to varying environments may also involve gene duplications3, obtaining the complete genome sequence of the European sea bass may help to identify the genetic basis for adaptation to euryhalinity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Most sea bass chromosomes are highly collinear with those of upper teleosts, confirming the evolutionary stability of fish genomes.</p>

# Metapopulation patterns of additive and nonadditive genetic variance in the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Guinand et al., 2017, Ecology and evolution.

<p style="text-align:justify";>As for many other species (Patarnello et al., 2007), pop- ulations of sea bass have been shown to be genetically differentiated between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and within the Mediterranean Sea itself (Quéré et al., 2012; Souche et al., 2015; Tine et al., 2014) (Figure 1). In sea bass, nuclear and mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers provided different pictures of genetic differentiation. Indeed, nuclear data generally demonstrated genetic homogeneity within the Atlantic, while the Mediterranean Sea is genetically structured, with one single panmictic population within the Western Mediterranean Sea (Naciri, Lemaire, Borsa, & Bonhomme, 1999; Qu?r? et al., 2012; Souche et al., 2015), and one main metapopulation within the Eastern Mediterranean Sea subdivided in slightly genetically differentiated local populations</p>

# QTL for body weight, morphometric traits and stress response in European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, Massault et al., 2010, Animal Genetics.

<p style="text-align:justify";>cortisol levels, had been previously assigned to parents based on genotypes of 31 DNA microsatellite markers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>An important economical trait is stress, either linked to pathogen infection or behaviour (such as confinement and handling). Cortisol, a widely accepted proxy for stress in fish, affects the immune system response (Engelsma et al. 2002). Therefore, if genomic regions are found that influ- ence the stress response, this could have a beneficial effect on the management of fitness. All these features represent multiple steps towards the use of genetic and molecular tools for improvement of production.</p>
