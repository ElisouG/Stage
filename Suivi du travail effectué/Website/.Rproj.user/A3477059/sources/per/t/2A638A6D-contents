# European sea bass genome and its variation provide insights into adaptation to euryhalinity and speciation, Tine et al., 2014, Nature Communications.

<p style="text-align:justify";>The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a temperate-zone euryhaline teleost of prime importance for aquaculture and fisheries. This species is subdivided into two naturally hybridizing lineages, one inhabiting the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the other the Mediterranean and Black seas.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>expansions of gene families specifically associated with ion and water regulation, high- lighting adaptation to variation in salinity.We further generate a genome-wide variation map through RAD-sequencing of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>This is an economically important species, and natural stocks are subject to intensive exploitation by professional and sport fisheries, thus raising future conservation and management issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>The European sea bass inhabits coastal waters, where reproduction occurs; however, it can also enter brackish waters in estuarine areas and coastal lagoons, and occasionally rivers. Thus, the European sea bass is an euryhaline fish tolerating a wide range of salinities (0-60 psu)1. Although several genes involved in the physiological response to variation in salinity have been identified2, the genetic basis of its broad halotolerance remains unclear. Because adaptation to varying environments may also involve gene duplications3, obtaining the complete genome sequence of the European sea bass may help to identify the genetic basis for adaptation to euryhalinity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Most sea bass chromosomes are highly collinear with those of upper teleosts, confirming the evolutionary stability of fish genomes.</p>

# Metapopulation patterns of additive and nonadditive genetic variance in the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Guinand et al., 2017, Ecology and evolution.

<p style="text-align:justify";>As for many other species (Patarnello et al., 2007), pop- ulations of sea bass have been shown to be genetically differentiated between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and within the Mediterranean Sea itself (Quéré et al., 2012; Souche et al., 2015; Tine et al., 2014) (Figure 1). In sea bass, nuclear and mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers provided different pictures of genetic differentiation. Indeed, nuclear data generally demonstrated genetic homogeneity within the Atlantic, while the Mediterranean Sea is genetically structured, with one single panmictic population within the Western Mediterranean Sea (Naciri, Lemaire, Borsa, & Bonhomme, 1999; Qu?r? et al., 2012; Souche et al., 2015), and one main metapopulation within the Eastern Mediterranean Sea subdivided in slightly genetically differentiated local populations</p>

# QTL for body weight, morphometric traits and stress response in European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, Massault et al., 2010, Animal Genetics.

<p style="text-align:justify";>cortisol levels, had been previously assigned to parents based on genotypes of 31 DNA microsatellite markers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>An important economical trait is stress, either linked to pathogen infection or behaviour (such as confinement and handling). Cortisol, a widely accepted proxy for stress in fish, affects the immune system response (Engelsma et al. 2002). Therefore, if genomic regions are found that influ- ence the stress response, this could have a beneficial effect on the management of fitness. All these features represent multiple steps towards the use of genetic and molecular tools for improvement of production.</p>

# A new SNP-based vision of the genetics of sex determination in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Palaiokostas et al., 2015, Genetics Selection Evolution

<p style="text-align:justify";>Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a reduced-representation sequencing platform that ex- ploits high-throughput sequencing methodologies, while the use of barcodes allows multiplexing of samples [18]. This technique can be used for the rapid discovery of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by sequencing parts of the genome at high depth, which of- fers the possibility to construct high-density linkage maps in a cost-efficient manner. Sex-determining regions have already been identified in Danio rerio (zebrafish), Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) and Hippoglossus hip- poglossus (Atlantic halibut) using RAD-seq [19–22]. In this study, we used RAD sequencing to identify SNPs in F2 crosses of D. labrax that originated initially from an F0 cross between two families with divergent sex ratios. First, a high-density linkage map was constructed, then quanti- tative trait loci (QTL) mapping and a genome-wideassociation study (GWAS) were performed. We also car- ried out a preliminary genomic prediction approach to test the potential of SNP-based selection for increasing either female ratio or body length.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Parentage assignment – general statistics Parentage assignment was performed with Vitassign V8- 5.1 [29] using 200 SNPs and with R/hsphase using all discovered SNPs and allowing for a maximum genotyping error of 3 % [30]. R v.3.0.1 was used for chi-square tests to detect significant deviations from the equal sex ratio and for calculating correlations between phenotypic sex and weight or length. SAS-GENMOD was used to test for sire and dam effects (and their interaction) on sex, using a pro- bit link function and a binomial distribution.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Construction of the linkage map The linkage map was constructed with Lep-Map [32]. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.05 and SNPs that deviated from the expected Mendelian segregation (P < 0.001) were excluded. Linkage groups were formed with a minimum LOD value of 10 using the SeparateChromosomes module of Lep-Map. SNPs within each linkage group were ordered by applying the OrderMarkers module. Map distances were estimated in centiMorgans (cM) using the Kosambi mapping function.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Heritability estimation Heritability of phenotypic sex was estimated on the li- ability scale using R/MCMCglmm [33]. The observed phenotype was considered to follow a binomial distribution. The probit link function was used as follows:
$yi∼B (probit‐1 (li))$ where yi is the observed phenotype coded as a binary trait and li is the latent variable. The latent variable was modelled as follows:
$li =µ+µi+ei$ where μ is the intercept, ui animal random effect that follows ~ N(0,Aσg 2), with A the pedigree-based relation-ship matrix and σg 2 the additive genetic variance, and ei the residual error. The additive genetic variance was estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) esti- mation, using a prior following the χ2 (1 df) distribution (10 000 000 iterations; 1 000 000 burn-in; 500 thin). Heritability was estimated using the following formula:
$σ2 h2 ¼ σ2 g g þσ2 e þ1$ ; where σg 2 is the previous estimated additive genetic variance and σe 2 is the residual variance that was fixed to 1 due to the identifiability issue with binary data [33].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>QTL mapping Sex-determining QTL were identified by Haley-Knott re- gression mapping using GridQTL [34, 35]. A half-sib model and a F2 sib regression analysis model of the en- tire pedigree were used, allowing for the existence of one QTL at tested intervals that were 1 cM apart. The models used had the following general form:
$yij ¼ mi þXz¼n z¼1μz ?pz þeij;$ where yij is the phenotypic sex of individual j belonging to full/half sib family i, with males coded as 1 and females as 2, mi is the F2 – half sib family specific inter- cept, μz is the effect of marker z, n is the number of pos- sible QTL genotypes of the tested position, pz is the probability of the inferred genotype (gz) based on flank- ing markers (pz = Pr(gz |M), M flanking markers) and eij is the residual error. Confidence intervals (95 %) were estimated using bootstraps with resampling (10 000 iter- ations). Two levels of significance were calculated based on chromosome (α = 0.01) or genome-wide thresholds (α = 0.05) by performing 1000 permutations, with the detected QTL referred to as suggestive or significant, respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>GWAS approach A GWAS was performed using R/rrBLUP [38] in order to test for SNPs associated with phenotypic sex. The model used was based on Yu et al. [39] and had the fol- lowing format:
$y ¼ XαþZuþe;$ where y is the vector of the phenotypes, α is the vector of marker effects, u is the vector of animal random effects ∼N(0,Gσg) and e is the vector of residuals. The matrix G represents the relationship matrix calculated from SNPs and σg 2 the additive genetic variance estimated using REML. X and Z are incidence matrices relating y to α and u, respectively. The Bonferroni correction was used to correct formultiple testing (Type I error rate= 0.05).</p>

# Gene flow at major transitional areas in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and the possible emergence of a hybrid swarm, Quéré et al., 2012, Ecology and Evolution.

<p style="text-align:justify";>Abstract : The population genetic structure of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) along a transect from the Atlantic Ocean (AO) to the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Sea differs from that of most other marine taxa in this area. Three populations (AO, Western Mediterranean [WM], EM) are recognized today, which were originally two allopatric populations. How two ancestral genetic units have evolved into three distinct units has not been addressed yet. Therefore, to inves- tigate mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the central WM population, its current status, and its connectivity with the two parental populations, we applied 20 nuclear loci that were either gene associated or gene independent. Results confirmed the existence of three distinct gene pools, with higher differ- entiation at two transitional areas, the Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) and of the Siculo-Tunisian Strait (STS), than within any population. Significant linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote excess indicated that the STS is probably another tension zone, as already described for the AOF. Neutrality tests fail to reveal marker loci that could be driven by selection within or among metapop- ulations, except for locus DLA0068. Collectively, results support that the central WM population arose by trapping two tensions zones at distinct geographic locations of limited connectivity. Population assignment further revealed that WM individuals were more introgressed than individuals from the other two metapopulations. This suggests that this population might result from hybrid swarming, and was or is still seeded by genes received through the filter of each tension zone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium </p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>Complementarily, genetic description of sample was assessed by computing LD. LD between pairs of loci was computed using GENETIX v4.05 (http:// genetix.univ-montp2.fr/) in each sample, and tested using permutation tests (5000 permutations). Finally, deviations from Hardy–Weinberg expectations (HWE) within each original sample and within each metapopulation were investigated using ^f (Weir and Cockerham 1984), also using GENETIX.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>Among-sample comparisons were assessed by estimat- ing levels of population differentiation using teta ,an estimator of FST. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>Their significance was tested according to the permutation procedure avail- able in GENETIX and corrected for multiple tests accord- ing to Benjamini and Yukitieli (2001) false discovery rate.</p>
