# Stacks : Deriving genotypes from RAD-seq short-read data using Stacks, Rochette et al., 2017, Nature Protocols.

<p style="text-align:justify";>Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) allows for the genome-wide discovery and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in hundreds of individuals at a time in model and nonmodel species alike. However, converting short-read sequencing data into reliable genotype data remains a nontrivial task, especially as RAD-seq is used in systems that have very diverse genomic properties. Here, we present a protocol to analyze RAD-seq data using the Stacks pipeline. This protocol will be of use in areas such as ecology and population genetics. It covers the assessment and demultiplexing of the sequencing data, read mapping, inference of RAD loci, genotype calling, and filtering of the output data, as well as providing two simple examples of downstream biological analyses. We place special emphasis on checking the soundness of the procedure and choosing the main parameters, given the properties of the data. The procedure can be completed in 1 week, but determining definitive methodological choices will typically take up to 1 month.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>a state-of-the-art procedure to derive genotypes from raw short-read data in the RAD-seq context. We demonstrate both a reference-based analysis and a strictly de novo analysis of the same data, as particularly in the fields in which RAD-seq is used it may not be possible to rely on a reference genome</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>the quality assessment and demultiplexing of the
raw data, mapping of reads (if a reference-based analysis is per- formed), assembly of RAD loci and calling of genotypes, and filtering and export of these genotypes for use in biological analyses</p>

# MAKER2 : an annotation pipeline and genome- database management tool for second- generation genome projects, Holt et al., 2011, BMC Bioinformatics

<p style="text-align:justify";>MAKER2 builds upon MAKER[6], an easy-to-use gen-
ome annotation pipeline that has seen wide adoption [7-19]. MAKER2 improves upon the de novo annotation capabilities of the original MAKER and integrates sup- port for multiple ab initio prediction tools. Major addi- tions to MAKER2 include integration of the Annotation Edit Distance (AED)[20] metric for improved quality control and downstream database management, support for mRNA-seq to allow researchers to leverage second generation sequencing technologies, and gene model pass-through capability; thus creating a first of itâ€™skind tool for updating and reannotating existing model organ- ism databases. The pipeline also supports distributed par- allelization on computer clusters via MPI which means MAKER2 can scale to datasets of virtually any size. MAKER2 can run on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and Darwin in Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>MAKER2 can both evaluate the global quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic annotations for manual review; these are functionalities offered by no other annotation tool.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>The reference gene models, ab initio gene predictions,
and evidence-based gene annotations were converted to GTF format using the maker2eval script packaged with MAKER2. Values for sensitivity and specificity were then produced using Eval.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>TopHat[36] v1.2.0 and Cufflinks[37] v0.9.3 were used to align and process these short reads. The script tophat2gff3 and cufflinks2gff3 were then used to process the results into GFF3 format. The resulting GFF3 files were provided to the est_gff option in MAKER2.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of gene predic- tion algorithms by comparing the resulting gene predic- tion to a well-supported reference annotation[43]. Sensitivity is defined as the fraction of a reference over- lapping a prediction; specificity is defined as the fraction of a prediction overlapping a reference; and accuracy is commonly defined as the average of sensitivity and spe- cificity (although several alternate formulations exist). Both sensitivity and specificity can be calculated for any feature in the genome at different levels of stringency (i. e. base pair level, exon level, etc.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>Next we produced de novo annotation and a re-anno-
tation dataset using MAKER2.To produce the re-annotation dataset, we again used the same EST, pro- tein, repeat, and SNAP files; however, we also passed MAKER2 all legacy annotations by indicating the loca- tion of the reference GFF3 file in the model_gff option.</p>

# dDocent : a RADseq, variant-calling pipeline designed for population genomics of non-model organisms, Puritz et al., 2014, PeerJ.

<p style="text-align:justify";>the variant-calling pipeline dDocent is introduced as a tool for generating
population genomic data; a brief methodological outline of the analysis pipeline also is presented. dDocent is a wrapper script designed to take raw flRAD data and produce population informative SNP calls (SNPs that are shared across the majority of individuals and populations), taking full advantage of both paired-end reads. dDocent is configured for organismswith high levels of nucleotide and Indel polymorphisms, such as are found in many marine organisms (Guo, Zou&Wagner, 2012; Keever et al., 2009; Sodergren et al., 2006;Waples, 1998;Ward,Woodwark & Skibinski, 1994); however, the pipeline also can be adjusted for low polymorphism species. As input, dDocent takes paired FASTQ files for individuals and outputs raw SNP and Indel calls as well as filtered SNP calls in VCF format. The pipeline and a comprehensive online manual can be found at (<http://dDocent.wordpress.com>). Finally, results of pipeline analyses, using both dDocent and Stacks, of populations of three species of marine fishes are provided to demonstrate the utility of dDocent compared to Stacks, the first and most comprehensive, existing software package forRADpopulation genomics</p>

<p style="text-align:justify";>There are two distinct modules of dDocent: dDocent.FB and dDocent.GATK.
dDocent.FB uses minimal, BAM-file preparation steps before calling SNPs and Indels, simultaneously using FreeBayes (Garrison &Marth, 2012). dDocent.GATK uses GATK (McKenna et al., 2010) for Indel realignment, SNP and Indel genotyping (using HaplotypeCaller), and variant quality-score recalibration, largely following GATK Best Practices recommendations (Van der Auwera et al., 2013; DePristo et al., 2011). The modules represent two different strategies for SNP/Indel calling that are completely independent of one another.</p>
