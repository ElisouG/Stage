abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

abstract = {The packaging of DNA into strings of nucleosomes is one of the features that allows eukaryotic cells to tightly regulate gene expression. The ordered disassembly of nucleosomes permits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to access the DNA, whereas nucleosomal reassembly impedes access, thus preventing transcription and mRNA synthesis. Chromatin modifications, chromatin remodellers, histone chaperones and histone variants regulate nucleosomal dynamics during transcription. Disregulation of nucleosome dynamics results in aberrant transcription initiation, producing non-coding RNAs. Ongoing research is elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure during transcription by preventing histone exchange, thereby limiting non-coding RNA expression.},

abstract = {Describing and explaining the geographic within-species variation in phenotypes ("phenogeography") in the sea over a species distribution range is central to our understanding of a variety of eco-evolutionary topics. However, phenogeographic studies that have a large potential to investigate adaptive variation are overcome by phylogeographic studies, still mainly focusing on neutral markers. How genotypic and phenotypic data could covary over large geographic scales remains poorly understood in marine species. We crossed 75 noninbred sires (five origins) and 26 dams (two origins; each side of a hybrid zone) in a factorial diallel cross in order to investigate geographic variation for early survival and sex ratio in the metapopulation of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a highly prized marine fish species. Full-sib families (N = 1,950) were produced and reared in a common environment. Parentage assignment of 7,200 individuals was performed with seven microsatellite markers. Generalized linear models showed significant additive effects for both traits and pleiotropy between traits. A significant nonadditive genetic effect was detected. Different expression of traits and distinct relative performances were found for reciprocal crosses involving populations located on each side of the main hybrid zone located at the Almeria-Oran front, illustrating asymmetric reproductive isolation. The poor fitness performance observed for the Western Mediterranean population of sea bass is discussed as it represents the main source of seed hatchery production, but also because it potentially illustrates nonadaptive introgression and maladaptation.},

abstract = {20 Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. 21 Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on 22 correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate 23 methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and 24 environment. Multivariate methods, which analyze many loci simultaneously, may be better 25 suited to these data since they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. 26 These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, 27 multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods, and five univariate and 28 differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found 29 that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low 30 detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations showed a superior 31 combination of low false positive and high true positive rates across all levels of selection. These 32 results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes, and levels 33 of population structure tested. The value of combining detections from different methods was 34 variable, and depended on study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Reanalysis of 35 genomic data from gray wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could 36 be identified using redundancy analysis, a constrained ordination. Although additional testing is 37 needed, this study indicates that constrained ordinations are an effective means of detecting 38 adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for 39 investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation. 40 3 Introduction},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is one of the most important farmed species in Mediterranean aquaculture. The observed sexual growth and maturity dimorphism in favour of females adds value towards deciphering the sex determination system of this species. Current knowledge indicates the existence of a polygenic sex determining determination system that interacts with temperature. This was explored by restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) marker analysis in a test panel of 175 offspring that originated from a factorial cross between two dams and four sires from a single full-sib family.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The first high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based linkage map for sea bass was constructed, consisting of 6706 SNPs on 24 linkage groups. Indications for putative sex-determining QTL (quantitative trait loci) that were significant at the genome-wide threshold were detected on linkage groups 6, 11 and 18 to 21, although a genome-wide association study (GWAS) did not identify individual significant SNPs at a genome-wide threshold. A preliminary genomic prediction approach that tested the efficiency of SNP-based selection for female sea bass showed a slight advantage compared to traditional pedigree-based selection. However, when the same models were tested on the same animals for selection for greater length, a clear advantage of the SNP-based selection was observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study provide additional support to the polygenic sex determination hypothesis in sea bass. In addition, identification of sex-ratio QTL may provide new opportunities for sex-ratio control in sea bass.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have become very popular in identifying genetic contributions to phenotypes. Millions of SNPs are being tested for their association with diseases and traits using linear or logistic regression models. This conceptually simple strategy encounters the following computational issues: a large number of tests and very large genotype files (many Gigabytes) which cannot be directly loaded into the software memory. One of the solutions applied on a grand scale is cluster computing involving large-scale resources. We show how to speed up the computations using matrix operations in pure R code. We improve speed: computation time from 6 hours is reduced to 10-15 minutes. Our approach can handle essentially an unlimited amount of covariates efficiently, using projections. Data files in GWAS are vast and reading them into computer memory becomes an important issue. However, much improvement can be made if the data is structured beforehand in a way allowing for easy access to blocks of SNPs. We propose several solutions based on the R packages ff and ncdf. We adapted the semi-parallel computations for logistic regression. We show that in a typical GWAS setting, where SNP effects are very small, we do not lose any precision and our computations are few hundreds times faster than standard procedures. We provide very fast algorithms for GWAS written in pure R code. We also show how to rearrange SNP data for fast access.},

abstract = {Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation. However, it remains unclear whether eRNAs are involved in the regulation of human heme oxygenase-1 gene (HO-1) induction. Here, we report that multiple nuclear-enriched eRNAs are transcribed from the regions adjacent to two human HO-1 enhancers (i.e. the distal E2 and proximal E1 enhancers), and some of these eRNAs are induced by the oxidative stress-causing reagent diethyl maleate (DEM). We demonstrated that the expression of one forward direction (5′ to 3′) eRNA transcribed from the human HO-1 E2 enhancer region (named human HO-1enhancer RNA E2-3; hereafter called eRNA E2-3) was induced by DEM in an NRF2-dependent manner in HeLa cells. Conversely, knockdown of BACH1, a repressor of HO-1 transcription, further increased DEM-inducible eRNA E2-3 transcription as well as HO-1 expression. In addition, we showed that knockdown of eRNA E2-3 selectively down-regulated DEM-induced HO-1 expression. Furthermore, eRNA E2-3 knockdown attenuated DEM-induced Pol II binding to the promoter and E2 enhancer regions of HO-1 without affecting NRF2 recruitment to the E2 enhancer. These findings indicate that eRNAE2-3 is functional and is required for HO-1 induction.},

abstract = {The population genetic structure of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) along a transect from the Atlantic Ocean (AO) to the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Sea differs from that of most other marine taxa in this area. Three populations (AO, Western Mediterranean [WM], EM) are recognized today, which were originally two allopatric populations. How two ancestral genetic units have evolved into three distinct units has not been addressed yet. Therefore, to investigate mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the central WM population, its current status, and its connectivity with the two parental populations, we applied 20 nuclear loci that were either gene associated or gene independent. Results confirmed the existence of three distinct gene pools, with higher differentiation at two transitional areas, the Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) and of the Siculo-Tunisian Strait (STS), than within any population. Significant linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote excess indicated that the STS is probably another tension zone, as already described for the AOF. Neutrality tests fail to reveal marker loci that could be driven by selection within or among metapopulations, except for locus DLA0068. Collectively, results support that the central WM population arose by trapping two tensions zones at distinct geographic locations of limited connectivity. Population assignment further revealed that WM individuals were more introgressed than individuals from the other two metapopulations. This suggests that this population might result from hybrid swarming, and was or is still seeded by genes received through the filter of each tension zone.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been leading the genetic study of human disease into an era of unprecedented productivity. Many bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to call variants from NGS data. The performance of these pipelines depends crucially on the variant caller used and on the calling strategies implemented. We studied the performance of four prevailing callers, SAMtools, GATK, glftools and Atlas2, using single-sample and multiple-sample variant-calling strategies. Using the same aligner, BWA, we built four single-sample and three multiple-sample calling pipelines and applied the pipelines to whole exome sequencing data taken from 20 individuals. We obtained genotypes generated by Illumina Infinium HumanExome v1.1 Beadchip for validation analysis and then used Sanger sequencing as a "gold-standard" method to resolve discrepancies for selected regions of high discordance. Finally, we compared the sensitivity of three of the single-sample calling pipelines using known simulated whole genome sequence data as a gold standard. Overall, for single-sample calling, the called variants were highly consistent across callers and the pairwise overlapping rate was about 0.9. Compared with other callers, GATK had the highest rediscovery rate (0.9969) and specificity (0.99996), and the Ti/Tv ratio out of GATK was closest to the expected value of 3.02. Multiple-sample calling increased the sensitivity. Results from the simulated data suggested that GATK outperformed SAMtools and glfSingle in sensitivity, especially for low coverage data. Further, for the selected discrepant regions evaluated by Sanger sequencing, variant genotypes called by exome sequencing versus the exome array were more accurate, although the average variant sensitivity and overall genotype consistency rate were as high as 95.87{\{}{\%}{\}} and 99.82{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively. In conclusion, GATK showed several advantages over other variant callers for general purpose NGS analyses. The GATK pipelines we developed perform very well.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this, we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD, CNVnator has high sensitivity (86{\%}-96{\%}), low false-discovery rate (3{\%}-20{\%}), high genotyping accuracy (93{\%}-95{\%}), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery ({\textless}200 bp in 90{\%} of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11{\%} of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios.},

abstract = {The dynamic interplay between chromatin modification (e.g. DNA methylation) and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) plays a critical role in gene transcription during stem cell development, establishment, and maintenance and in the cellular response to extracellular stimuli such as those that cause DNA damage. Pol II is recruited to the promoter-proximal regions of numerous inactive genes at high conentrations in a process called Pol II stalling. This is a key process prior to gene activation and it involves many interacting factors. Chromatin modification including nucleosome position is dependent on chromatin structure. Stalled genes create a particular structural conformation of chromatin, which acts as a target for chromatin modification. In this way, Pol II stalling may be regarded as a type of signal for chromatin modification in these regions during the dynamic transition between stalled and activated genes.},

Thus, functional profiling methods have become essential in diverse scenarios such as microarray experiments, proteomics, etc. We present the FatiGO+, a web-based tool for the functional profiling of genome-scale experiments, specially oriented to the interpretation of microarray experiments. In addition to different functional annotations (gene ontology, KEGG pathways, Interpro motifs, Swissprot keywords and text-mining based bioentities related to diseases and chemical compounds) FatiGO+ includes, as a novelty, regulatory and structural information. The regulatory information used includes predictions of targets for distinct regulatory elements (obtained from the Transfac and CisRed databases). Additionally FatiGO+ uses predictions of target motifs of miRNA to infer which of these can be activated or deactivated in the sample of genes studied. Finally, properties of gene products related to their relative location and connections in the interactome have also been used. Also, enrichment of any of these functional terms can be directly analysed on chromosomal coordinates. FatiGO+ can be found at: http://www.fatigoplus.org and within the Babelomics environment http://www.babelomics.org.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: The advantages of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology include long reads, low systematic bias, and high consensus read accuracy. Here we use these attributes to improve on the genome annotation of the parasitic hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum using PacBio RNA-Seq. Results: We sequenced 192,888 circular consensus sequences (CCS) derived from cDNAs generated using the CloneTech SMARTer system. These SMARTer-SMRT libraries were normalized and size-selected providing a robust population of expressed structural genes for subsequent genome annotation. We demonstrate PacBio mRNA sequences based genome annotation improvement, compared to genome annotation using conventional sequencing-by-synthesis alone, by identifying 1609 (9.2{\%}) new genes, extended the length of 3965 (26.7{\%}) genes and increased the total genomic exon length by 1.9Mb (12.4{\%}). Non-coding sequence representation (primarily from UTRs based on dT reverse transcription priming) was particularly improved, increasing in total length by fifteen-fold, by increasing both the length and number of UTR exons. In addition, the UTR data provided by these CCS allowed for the identification of a novel SL2 splice leader sequence for A. ceylanicum and an increase in the number and proportion of functionally annotated genes. RNA-seq data also confirmed some of the newly annotated genes and gene features. Conclusion: Overall, PacBio data has supported a significant improvement in gene annotation in this genome, and is an appealing alternative or complementary technique for genome annotation to the other transcript sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The sequencing of the human genome has made it possible to identify an informative set of {\textgreater}1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome that can be used to carry out genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The availability of massive amounts of GWAS data has necessitated the development of new biostatistical methods for quality control, imputation and analysis issues including multiple testing. This work has been successful and has enabled the discovery of new associations that have been replicated in multiple studies. However, it is now recognized that most SNPs discovered via GWAS have small effects on disease susceptibility and thus may not be suitable for improving health care through genetic testing. One likely explanation for the mixed results of GWAS is that the current biostatistical analysis paradigm is by design agnostic or unbiased in that it ignores all prior knowledge about disease pathobiology. Further, the linear modeling framework that is employed in GWAS often considers only one SNP at a time thus ignoring their genomic and environmental context. There is now a shift away from the biostatistical approach toward a more holistic approach that recognizes the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relationship that is characterized by significant heterogeneity and gene-gene and gene-environment interaction. We argue here that bioinformatics has an important role to play in addressing the complexity of the underlying genetic basis of common human diseases. The goal of this review is to identify and discuss those GWAS challenges that will require computational methods.},

Assessment of the risk requires access to a variety of heterogeneous biological databases and analytical tools. FASTSNP (function analysis and selection tool for single nucleotide polymorphisms) is a web server that allows users to efficiently identify and prioritize high-risk SNPs according to their phenotypic risks and putative functional effects. A unique feature of FASTSNP is that the functional effect information used for SNP prioritization is always up-to-date, because FASTSNP extracts the information from 11 external web servers at query time using a team of web wrapper agents. Moreover, FASTSNP is extendable by simply deploying more Web wrapper agents. To validate the results of our prioritization, we analyzed 1569 SNPs from the SNP500Cancer database. The results show that SNPs with a high predicted risk exhibit low allele frequencies for the minor alleles, consistent with a well-known finding that a strong selective pressure exists for functional polymorphisms. We have been using FASTSNP for 2 years and FASTSNP enables us to discover a novel promoter polymorphism. FASTSNP is available at http://fastsnp.ibms.sinica.edu.tw.},

abstract = {Evolutionary transitions between sexual modes could be potent forces in genome evolution [1, 2]. Several Caenorhabditis nematode species have evolved self-fertile hermaphrodites from the obligately outcrossing females of their ancestors [3]. We explored the relationship between sexual mode and global gene expression by comparing two selfing species, C. elegans and C. briggsae, with three phylogenetically informative outcrossing relatives, C. remanei, C. brenneri, and C. japonica. Adult transcriptome assemblies from the selfing species are consistently and strikingly smaller than those of the outcrossing species. Against this background of overall simplification, genes conserved in multiple outcrossing species with strong sex-biased expression are even more likely to be missing from the genomes of the selfing species. In addition, the sexual regulation of remaining transcripts has diverged markedly from the ancestral pattern in both selfing lineages, though in distinct ways. Thus, both the complexity and the sexual specialization of transciptomes are rapidly altered in response to the evolution of self-fertility. These changes may result from the combination of relaxed sexual selection and a recently reported genetic mechanism favoring genome shrinkage [4] in partial selfers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a promising technology to re-sequence protein coding genes for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNV), while simultaneously obtaining information on structural variations and gene expression perturbations. We asked whether RNA-seq is suitable for the detection of driver mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These leukemias are caused by a combination of gene fusions, over-expression of transcription factors and cooperative point mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed 31 T-ALL patient samples and 18 T-ALL cell lines by high-coverage paired-end RNA-seq. First, we optimized the detection of SNVs in RNA-seq data by comparing the results with exome re-sequencing data. We identified known driver genes with recurrent protein altering variations, as well as several new candidates including H3F3A, PTK2B, and STAT5B. Next, we determined accurate gene expression levels from the RNA-seq data through normalizations and batch effect removal, and used these to classify patients into T-ALL subtypes. Finally, we detected gene fusions, of which several can explain the over-expression of key driver genes such as TLX1, PLAG1, LMO1, or NKX2-1; and others result in novel fusion transcripts encoding activated kinases (SSBP2-FER and TPM3-JAK2) or involving MLLT10. In conclusion, we present novel analysis pipelines for variant calling, variant filtering, and expression normalization on RNA-seq data, and successfully applied these for the detection of translocations, point mutations, INDELs, exon-skipping events, and expression perturbations in T-ALL.},

abstract = {Objectives of this study were to determine the combined market share of breeding companies in aquaculture production in Europe, to describe the main characteristics of breeding companies and their programs, and to provide per species estimates on cumulative genetic gain in growth performance. Surveys were conducted among breeding companies of five major species cultured in Europe: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, European seabass, gilthead seabream, and turbot. The market share was estimated as the combined egg or juvenile production of breeding companies relative to the total egg or juvenile production in Europe for each species in 2012. Cumulative genetic gain was estimated from the number of selected generations in current breeding programs, combined with genetic trends, reported selection responses in literature, and phenotypic differences. The combined market share of breeding companies ranged from 43–56{\%} for seabass to 100{\%} for turbot. The total volume of fish production in Europe that originated from selective breeding was 1653–1706 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 80–83{\%} of the total aquaculture production. Over species, there were 37 breeding programs of which the majority performed family selection. Growth performance was universally selected upon. Cumulative genetic gain in growth performance varied from + 65{\%} for turbot to + 900{\%} for trout in terms of harvest weight, and from + 25{\%} for turbot to + 200{\%} for trout in terms of thermal growth coefficient. It is concluded that selective breeding has a major impact on European aquaculture and will contribute to future growth of the sector. Statement of relevance This manuscript helps to understand the impact of selective breeding on European aquaculture. It shows that the adoption of selective breeding is much higher in Europe than globally. It demonstrates that selective breeding has led to major improvements.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant genetic variant found in vertebrates and invertebrates. SNP discovery has become a highly automated, robust and relatively inexpensive process allowing the identification of many thousands of mutations for model and non-model organisms. Annotating large numbers of SNPs can be a difficult and complex process. Many tools available are optimised for use with organisms densely sampled for SNPs, such as humans. There are currently few tools available that are species non-specific or support non-model organism data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present SNPdat, a high throughput analysis tool that can provide a comprehensive annotation of both novel and known SNPs for any organism with a draft sequence and annotation. Using a dataset of 4,566 SNPs identified in cattle using high-throughput DNA sequencing we demonstrate the annotations performed and the statistics that can be generated by SNPdat.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: SNPdat provides users with a simple tool for annotation of genomes that are either not supported by other tools or have a small number of annotated SNPs available. SNPdat can also be used to analyse datasets from organisms which are densely sampled for SNPs. As a command line tool it can easily be incorporated into existing SNP discovery pipelines and fills a niche for analyses involving non-model organisms that are not supported by many available SNP annotation tools. SNPdat will be of great interest to scientists involved in SNP discovery and analysis projects, particularly those with limited bioinformatics experience.},

abstract = {Background: Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies. Results: We present MAKER2, a genome annotation and data management tool designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded, parallelized application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes where training-data are limited, of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2 also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations, significantly improving their quality. We also show that MAKER2 can evaluate the quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic annotations for manual review. Conclusions: MAKER2 is the first annotation engine specifically designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 scales to datasets of any size, requires little in the way of training data, and can use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality. It can also update and manage legacy genome annotation datasets. Background},

abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via "SNP chip" microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) generate relationships between hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex phenotypes. The contribution of the traditionally overlooked copy number variations (CNVs) to complex traits is also being actively studied. To facilitate the interpretation of the data and the designing of follow-up experimental validations, we have developed a database that enables the sensible prioritization of these variants by combining several approaches, involving not only publicly available physical and functional annotations but also multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) annotations as well as annotations of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). RESULTS For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e.g. physical and functional annotations); and (iv) summary information from other GWAS. For each gene, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) eQTLs for the gene (both local and distant SNPs) and (ii) the coverage of all variants in the HapMap at that gene on each high-throughput platform. For each genomic region, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) physical and functional annotations of all SNPs, genes and known CNVs within the region and (ii) all genes regulated by the eQTLs within the region.

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The sequencing of the human genome has made it possible to identify an informative set of {\textgreater}1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome that can be used to carry out genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The availability of massive amounts of GWAS data has necessitated the development of new biostatistical methods for quality control, imputation and analysis issues including multiple testing. This work has been successful and has enabled the discovery of new associations that have been replicated in multiple studies. However, it is now recognized that most SNPs discovered via GWAS have small effects on disease susceptibility and thus may not be suitable for improving health care through genetic testing. One likely explanation for the mixed results of GWAS is that the current biostatistical analysis paradigm is by design agnostic or unbiased in that it ignores all prior knowledge about disease pathobiology. Further, the linear modeling framework that is employed in GWAS often considers only one SNP at a time thus ignoring their genomic and environmental context. There is now a shift away from the biostatistical approach toward a more holistic approach that recognizes the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relationship that is characterized by significant heterogeneity and gene-gene and gene-environment interaction. We argue here that bioinformatics has an important role to play in addressing the complexity of the underlying genetic basis of common human diseases. The goal of this review is to identify and discuss those GWAS challenges that will require computational methods.},

Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

abstract = {Background: Fully isogenic lines in fish can be developed using “mitotic” gynogenesis (suppression of first zygotic mitosis following inactivation of the sperm genome). However, genome-wide verification of the steps in this process has seldom been applied. We used ddRADseq to generate SNP markers in a meiotic gynogenetic family of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax): (i) to verify the lack of paternal contribution in a meiotic gynogenetic family; (ii) to generate a gene-centromere map from this family; (iii) to identify telomeric markers that could distinguish mitotic gynogenetics from meiotic gynogenetics, which sometimes arise spontaneously in mitotic gynogenetic families. Results: From a single meiotic gynogenetic family consisting of 79 progeny, 42 million sequencing reads (Illumina, trimmed to 148 bases) resolved 6866 unique RAD-tags. The 340 male-informative SNP markers that were identified confirmed the lack of paternal contribution. A gene-centromere map was constructed based on 804 female-informative SNPs in 24 linkage groups (2n = 48) with a total length of 1251.02 cM (initial LG assignment was based on the seabass genome assembly, dicLab v1). Chromosome arm structure could be clearly discerned from the pattern of heterozygosity in each linkage group in 18 out of 24 LGs: the other six showed anomalies that appeared to be related to issues in the genome assembly. Conclusion: Genome-wide screening enabled substantive verification of the production of the gynogenetic family used in this study. The large number of telomeric and subtelomeric markers with high heterozygosity values in the meiotic gynogenetic family indicate that such markers could be used to clearly distinguish between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetics.

abstract = {Growth performance and reduced stress response are traits of major interest in fish production. Growth and stress-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been already identified in several salmonid species, but little effort has been devoted to charrs (genus Salvelinus). Moreover, most QTL studies to date focused on one or very few traits, and little investigation has been devoted to QTL identification for gene expression. Here, our objective was to identify QTL for 27 phenotypes related to growth and stress responses in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), which is one of the most economically important freshwater aquaculture species in Canada. Phenotypes included 12 growth parameters, six blood and plasma variables, three hepatic variables, and one plasma hormone level as well as the relative expression measurements of five genes of interest linked to growth regulation. QTL analysis relied on a linkage map recently built from S. fontinalis consisting of both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, n = 266) and microsatellite (n =81) markers in an F(2) interstrain hybrid population (n = 171). We identified 63 growth-related QTL and four stress-related QTL across 18 of the 40 linkage groups of the brook charr linkage map. Percent variance explained, confidence interval, and allelic QTL effects also were investigated to provide insight into the genetic architecture of growth- and stress-related QTL. QTL related to growth performance and stress response that were identified could be classified into two groups: (1) a group composed of the numerous, small-effect QTL associated with some traits related to growth (i.e., weight) that may be under the control of a large number of genes or pleiotropic genes, and (2) a group of less numerous QTL associated with growth (i.e., gene expression) and with stress-related QTL that display a larger effect, suggesting that these QTL are under the control of a limited number of genes of major effect. This study represents a first step toward the identification of genes potentially linked to phenotypic variation of growth and stress response in brook charr. The ultimate goal is to provide new tools for developing Molecular Assisted Selection for this species.},

However, there is a growing gap between the generation of raw sequencing data and the extraction of meaningful biological information. Here, we describe a protocol to use the ANNOVAR (ANNOtate VARiation) software to facilitate fast and easy variant annotations, including gene-based, region-based and filter-based annotations on a variant call format (VCF) file generated from human genomes. We further describe a protocol for gene-based annotation of a newly sequenced nonhuman species. Finally, we describe how to use a user-friendly and easily accessible web server called wANNOVAR to prioritize candidate genes for a Mendelian disease. The variant annotation protocols take 5-30 min of computer time, depending on the size of the variant file, and 5-10 min of hands-on time. In summary, through the command-line tool and the web server, these protocols provide a convenient means to analyze genetic variants generated in humans and other species.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {Sea bass is a major species in Mediterranean aquaculture, and is now being subject to selective breeding programmes for faster growth. In terrestrial species, it was demonstrated that fast growth may be linked to a correlated degradation of fitness traits. In this experiment, we evaluated 600 young sea bass from a factorial mating of 76 sires and 13 dams. The sires were from four genetic groups, wild (W), domesticated (D), and selected for growth (2 groups, M and P). The 600 offspring were submitted to two acute confinement stress challenges at 6weeks intervals, and plasma cortisol at one hour post stress was measured. The same fish were also submitted to two swimming challenges at a 5days interval, where the maximum sustained swimming speed (Umax) of each fish was evaluated. Parentage was assessed by genotyping of 12 microsatellites. 554 fish had both valid parentage and phenotypes. Cortisol had a low repeatability (r=0.30 between the two successive measurements) while repeatability was moderate for Umax(r=0.62). However, genetic correlations between successive measurements were very high ({\textgreater}0.96) for both traits, indicating that successive measurements were related to the same trait. Heritability was moderate for mean post-stress cortisol (h2=0.34±0.09) and Umax(h2=0.48±0.08). When Umaxwas expressed in m.s-1, it was negatively correlated to cortisol (rA=-0.48±0.08) and weakly correlated to body weight (rA=0.12±0.16), but figures changed when it was expressed in Body Lengths.s-1(h2=0.55±0.08, rA=-0.10±0.19 with cortisol and rA=-0.64±0.07 with body weight, respectively). Cortisol was moderately negatively correlated with body weight (rA=-0.36±0.18). The four lines did not differ for cortisol or Umax, but when Umaxwas expressed in BL.s-1it tended to be lower in the two selected lines - which were also significantly larger. However, this is likely due to a phenotypic decrease of relative Umaxwith increasing body size. We conclude that selection for growth and/or domestication should not impact maximum sustained swimming speed in the European sea bass, but may tend to favour animals with low cortisol responsiveness. These traits could be used to orientate functional capabilities other than productivity in sea bass. Statement of relevance: We estimate heritability of cortisol stress response and (for the first time) in European sea bass, as well as their correlations with growth. We show moderate correlations, and no correlated response to selection for growth. We also provide methods to evaluate these traits on large number of fishes. This can be useful to monitor and design breeding programmes.},

abstract = {The core output of a gene annotation project could be described as an in silico transcriptome: a collection of 'models' referred to in this Review as a genebuild. However, genebuilds are found in a data server, not in the cell: they are only representations of the tran-scriptome that exists in nature. This fact has important implications for the study of biology: gene annotation is a key mechanism through which information is lev-eraged from genome sequences, and deficiencies in gen-ebuilds will be propagated into downstream analyses. Thus, how close are our genebuilds to actual transcrip-tomes? Every publication seems to describe an entity that is larger, more dynamic and more functionally diverse than previously thought (as illustrated in FIG. 1) and this picture becomes even more complicated when considering the genomic sequences that regulate genes. In fact, the sheer complexity of the transcriptome may cause one to ask whether it is even possible that it could ever be completely described in silico. However, we are begging the question of whether we actually need to fully capture this complexity. A key annotation question concerns the proportion of the transcriptome that con-tributes to cellular function, and it could be argued that the goal of annotation projects should be to describe only this 'functional transcriptome': to extract the signal from the noise. In this Review, we discuss the current state of play in higher eukaryotic gene annotation, and attempt to take genebuilds out of the 'black box' for the benefit of annotation users. Throughout, we use an updated defi-nition of the term 'gene' , beyond the traditional protein-coding criterion, as described further in REF. 1. First, we explain the key principles by which these resources are made, and why annotation projects are proceeding along alternative lines for different genomes. Inevitably, more work has been carried out on the human genome than any other, and many aspects of genome annotation are most effectively explained in this context. However, although human workflows are frequently re-used in the description of other genomes, such projects are not truly analogous. This is because their scientific goals are often substantially different — typically more limi-ted in scope — but also because the resources avail-able to support annotation have changed dramatically in recent years. Second, even human genebuilds have 'blind spots' , and we wish to help users appreciate the biological information that is missing in such resources and how this can affect their work. The missing infor-mation generally reflects biological questions that remain unanswered, in particular, the issue of transcript functionality. Nonetheless, our biological understand-ing of the transcriptome is developing rapidly, and leaps in understanding are also being made in neighbouring fields of molecular biology, including proteomics, gene regulation and epigenomics. We explain below how gene annotation projects are coordinating efforts to combine such data sets into fully integrated views of genomic organization. Even so, it is clear that increas-ing genebuild complexity presents a considerable prac-tical challenge to scientists, and we end this Review by discussing the problems that are faced by annotation projects in improving their usability.},

abstract = {Natural mating and mass spawning in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L., Moronidae, Teleostei) complicate genetic studies and the implementation of selective breeding schemes. We utilized a two-step experimental design for detecting QTL in mass-spawning species: 2122 offspring from natural mating between 57 parents (22 males, 34 females and one missing) phenotyped for body weight, eight morphometric traits and cortisol levels, had been previously assigned to parents based on genotypes of 31 DNA microsatellite markers. Five large full-sib families (five sires and two dams) were selected from the offspring (570 animals), which were genotyped with 67 additional markers. A new genetic map was compiled, specific to our population, but based on the previously published map. QTL mapping was performed with two methods: half-sib regression analysis (paternal and maternal) and variance component analysis accounting for all family relationships. Two significant QTL were found for body weight on linkage group 4 and 6, six significant QTL for morphometric traits on linkage groups 1B, 4, 6, 7, 15 and 23 and three suggestive QTL for stress response on linkage groups 3, 14 and 23. The QTL explained between 8{\%} and 38{\%} of phenotypic variance. The results are the first step towards identifying genes involved in economically important traits like body weight and stress response in European sea bass.},

abstract = {The concept of absorptive capacity was introduced by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Since then it has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. Despite the growing interest in absorptive capacity it is unclear what this large stream of papers has collectively accomplished. The used definitions, antecedents, components and outcomes of the construct are extremely heterogeneous. Due to this heterogeneity, the empirical study of the construct remains difficult. There is no standard measure and no standard method of measurement, which can be used in empirical research. To bring more clarity into this research area, this paper provides a critical review of previous empirical treatments of absorptive capacity. For this purpose, different methods of measurement are classified in the following way: within quantitative methods proxy indicators and perceptive instruments are differentiated. Proxy indicators use single firm-level data for measuring absorptive capacity and can be input-oriented (R{\&}D efforts, R{\&}D human capital) or output-oriented (R{\&}D patents, R{\&}D publications). Perceptive instruments imply that researchers develop single questions or a set of questions, which reflect absorptive capacity or parts of it at the operational level. The main weakness of both proxy indicators and perceptive instruments is that they don't meet the complexity and emergence of the construct. Only few qualitative studies have started to adopt a new perspective, recognizing the process and practice-based character of absorptive capacity. In summary, the critical review prints out the necessity of advancing research in this area. For this reason, we set out to develop an alternative approach to capture absorptive capacity. It is a practice-oriented approach that allows studying actual absorptive practices in real world situations and enables researchers to capture the complex, embedded, and context-dependent patterns of acting.},

abstract = {Heat tolerance is a complex and economically important trait for catfish genetic breeding programs. With global climate change, it is becoming an increasingly important trait. To better understand the molecular basis of heat stress, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out using the 250 K catfish SNP array with interspecific backcross progenies, which derived from crossing female channel catfish with male F1 hybrid catfish (female channel catfish 9 male blue catfish). Three significant associated SNPs were detected by performing an EMMAX approach for GWAS. The SNP located on linkage group 14 explained 12.1{\%} of phenotypical variation. The other two SNPs, located on linkage group 16, explained 11.3 and 11.5{\%} of phenotypical variation respectively. A total of 14 genes with heat stress related functions were detected within the significant associated regions. Among them, five genes—TRAF2, FBXW5, ANAPC2, UBR1 and KLHL29— have known functions in the protein degradation process through the ubiquitination pathway. Other genes related to heat stress include genes involved in protein biosynthesis (PRPF4 and SYNCRIP), protein folding (DNAJC25), molecule and iron transport (SLC25A46 and CLIC5), cytoskeletal reorganization (COL12A1) and energy metabolism (COX7A2, PLCB1 and PLCB4) processes. The results provide fundamental information about genes and pathways that is useful for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of heat stress. The associated SNPs could be promising candidates for selecting heat-tolerant catfish lines after validating their effects on larger and various catfish populations.},

This species is subdivided into two naturally hybridizing lineages, one inhabiting the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the other the Mediterranean and Black seas. Here we provide a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of its genome that shows a high degree of synteny with the more highly derived teleosts. We find expansions of gene families specifically associated with ion and water regulation, highlighting adaptation to variation in salinity. We further generate a genome-wide variation map through RAD-sequencing of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. We show that variation in local recombination rates strongly influences the genomic landscape of diversity within and differentiation between lineages. Comparing predictions of alternative demographic models to the joint allele-frequency spectrum indicates that genomic islands of differentiation between sea bass lineages were generated by varying rates of introgression across the genome following a period of geographical isolation.},

However, it is not clear whether starvation affects only immediate offspring or has lasting effects; it is also unclear how such epigenetic information is inherited. Small RNA-induced gene silencing can persist over several generations via transgenerationally inherited small RNA molecules in C. elegans, but all known transgenerational silencing responses are directed against foreign DNA introduced into the organism. We found that starvation-induced developmental arrest, a natural and drastic environmental change, leads to the generation of small RNAs that are inherited through at least three consecutive generations. These small, endogenous, transgenerationally transmitted RNAs target genes with roles in nutrition. We defined genes that are essential for this multigenerational effect. Moreover, we show that the F3 offspring of starved animals show an increased lifespan, corroborating the notion of a transgenerational memory of past conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple "island" model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views population structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is one of the most important farmed species in Mediterranean aquaculture. The observed sexual growth and maturity dimorphism in favour of females adds value towards deciphering the sex determination system of this species. Current knowledge indicates the existence of a polygenic sex determining determination system that interacts with temperature. This was explored by restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) marker analysis in a test panel of 175 offspring that originated from a factorial cross between two dams and four sires from a single full-sib family.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The first high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based linkage map for sea bass was constructed, consisting of 6706 SNPs on 24 linkage groups. Indications for putative sex-determining QTL (quantitative trait loci) that were significant at the genome-wide threshold were detected on linkage groups 6, 11 and 18 to 21, although a genome-wide association study (GWAS) did not identify individual significant SNPs at a genome-wide threshold. A preliminary genomic prediction approach that tested the efficiency of SNP-based selection for female sea bass showed a slight advantage compared to traditional pedigree-based selection. However, when the same models were tested on the same animals for selection for greater length, a clear advantage of the SNP-based selection was observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study provide additional support to the polygenic sex determination hypothesis in sea bass. In addition, identification of sex-ratio QTL may provide new opportunities for sex-ratio control in sea bass.},

@article{Puritz2014a,
abstract = {Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has become a powerful and useful approach for population genomics. Currently, no software exists that utilizes both paired-end reads from RADseq data to efficiently produce population-informative variant calls, especially for non-model organisms with large effective population sizes and high levels of genetic polymorphism. dDocent is an analysis pipeline with a user-friendly, command-line interface designed to process individually barcoded RADseq data (with double cut sites) into informative SNPs/Indels for population-level analyses. The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling. The pipeline and a comprehensive user guide can be found at http://dDocent.wordpress.com.},

abstract = {The packaging of DNA into strings of nucleosomes is one of the features that allows eukaryotic cells to tightly regulate gene expression. The ordered disassembly of nucleosomes permits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to access the DNA, whereas nucleosomal reassembly impedes access, thus preventing transcription and mRNA synthesis. Chromatin modifications, chromatin remodellers, histone chaperones and histone variants regulate nucleosomal dynamics during transcription. Disregulation of nucleosome dynamics results in aberrant transcription initiation, producing non-coding RNAs. Ongoing research is elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure during transcription by preventing histone exchange, thereby limiting non-coding RNA expression.},

@article{Jonkers2014a,
abstract = {Production of mRNA depends critically on the rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells, we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol, and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq. Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95{\%} of genes, showing that pause escape, like initiation, is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle. Moreover, paused Pol II is relatively stable, as evidenced from half-life measurements at ∼3200 genes. Finally, tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes. Notably, Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons. Furthermore, intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial, and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: 1$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: RNA sequencing is a flexible and powerful new approach for measuring gene, exon, or isoform expression. To maximize the utility of RNA sequencing data, new statistical methods are needed for clustering, differential expression, and other analyses. A major barrier to the development of new statistical methods is the lack of RNA sequencing datasets that can be easily obtained and analyzed in common statistical software packages such as R. To speed up the development process, we have created a resource of analysis-ready RNA-sequencing datasets. 2$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESCRIPTION: ReCount is an online resource of RNA-seq gene count tables and auxilliary data. Tables were built from raw RNA sequencing data from 18 different published studies comprising 475 samples and over 8 billion reads. Using the Myrna package, reads were aligned, overlapped with gene models and tabulated into gene-by-sample count tables that are ready for statistical analysis. Count tables and phenotype data were combined into Bioconductor ExpressionSet objects for ease of analysis. ReCount also contains the Myrna manifest files and R source code used to process the samples, allowing statistical and computational scientists to consider alternative parameter values. 3$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By combining datasets from many studies and providing data that has already been processed from. fastq format into ready-to-use. RData and. txt files, ReCount facilitates analysis and methods development for RNA-seq count data. We anticipate that ReCount will also be useful for investigators who wish to consider cross-study comparisons and alternative normalization strategies for RNA-seq.},
